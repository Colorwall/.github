## 📂 Source Code Status

ColorWall will be open source as soon as we get certificates for it

Publishing to the Microsoft Store requires a developer license and related costs, which we are currently self-funding. To ensure sustainability and proper release management, we plan to open-source the project once distribution infrastructure is secured.

Community support directly helps with licensing, signing certificates, and long-term development.

Transparency and community collaboration remain long-term goals of this project.
