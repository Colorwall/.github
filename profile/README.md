## 📂 Source Code Status

ColorWall is currently closed-source as in today's world of A.I, anyone can copy a working logic and change the front-end. 

Publishing to the Microsoft Store requires a developer license and related costs, which we are currently self-funding. To ensure sustainability and proper release management, we plan to open-source the project once distribution infrastructure is secured.

If you would like to support the project and help accelerate open-sourcing efforts, you can contribute here:

Community support directly helps with licensing, signing certificates, and long-term development.

Transparency and community collaboration remain long-term goals of this project.
